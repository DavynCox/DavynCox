Hi, I'm Davyn Cox. I am an aspiring web developer from Seattle, Washington. While completing my finance degree at Central Washington Univeristy,
I developed an interest in quantitative finance and web development. I have been teaching myself Python and JavaScript, focusing on the React.js,
Solid.js, and Django frameworks.
